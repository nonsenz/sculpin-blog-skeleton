just a short note: i really love this simple game and can't stop playing it.
check it out [here](https://swarmsim.github.io/). it's build with coffeescript
and angular and you can look at the sources [on github](https://github.com/erosson/swarm).
some community like things are going on at [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/swarmsim/).
i looks like [the stats](http://www.seethestats.com/site/swarmsim.github.io/STSlT5DxvZf)
